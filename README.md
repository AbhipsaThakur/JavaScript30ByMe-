# 💻 30 Days - 30 JavaScript Projects 🚀

Welcome to my **JavaScript30ByMe** repository!

This collection of 30 JavaScript projects was completed during my **2nd year of engineering** as part of my journey to strengthen my front-end development skills.  
Now, in my **4th year**, I'm publishing these on GitHub as a **portfolio showcase** to demonstrate my learning progress, dedication, and practical hands-on experience with **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.
